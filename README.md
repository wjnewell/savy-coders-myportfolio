# Woo's Portfolio

## This is an even smaller header

### Even smaller...

###### Quite small

Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!

_This text is in italics._

**_A penny earned is a penny spent._**

**_This text is in both._**

~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\*
right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!
